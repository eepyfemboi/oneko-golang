# oneko-golang
a better version of the oneko desktop thingie i made bcuz its golang and doesnt have to deal with windows c# bullshit fuckery

with this one it has a thingie in the system tray as shown below

![hi](https://i.imghost.cc/imghost.cc__GE4pbJSUnu.jpeg)

it has an option to auto run when u log in to windows, and a button that will take u to https://sleepie.dev/oneko, and a button that closes the program, so u dont have to use task manager to close it anymore

the animation speed and a few other things are kinda buggy and im too lazy to make an auto updater so maybe check back here in a week or month or ten idk its honestly a 50/50 chance that i actually remember to fix it
